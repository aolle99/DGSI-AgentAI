Once I have both numbers, I can add them together to get the combined weight.\\n\\nWait, but how do I use the action? The example shows using 'average_dog_weight: BreedName'.

Then sum both results.\\n\\nI should make sure to use the exact breed names as specified in the action's examples. For instance, 'Collie' was used for Collies, so maybe 'Border Collie' is the correct term here. Similarly, 'Scottish Terrier' might be the exact breed name. But I need to confirm if the action accepts 'Scottish Terrier' as a valid breed. If not, maybe it's a typo or needs to be simplified.

      "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user asked about the combined weight of their two dogs: a Border Collie and a Scottish Terrier. Earlier, I looked up the average weights for both breeds. For the Border Collie, the observation was 16 kg, and the Scottish Terrier was 8 kg. I added those together to get 24 kg. Wait, but in the previous example, the assistant had a Border Collie weight of 25 kg and Scottish Terrier of 8 kg, leading to 33 kg. But here, the observation for Border Collie is 16 kg. So maybe there was a mistake in the initial data?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the user's current question is separate. Let me check the history again. Oh, in the first example, the user had a Border Collie and Scottish Terrier. The assistant first thought the Border Collie was 25 kg, but then in the observation, it's stated as 16 kg. Wait, maybe there was a confusion between different breeds? Or perhaps the initial data had an error. But in this current scenario, the user is asking again about their two dogs. The previous assistant's answer had a Border Collie at 25 kg, but the observation here says 16 kg. So I need to correct that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, maybe there was a mix-up between different breeds. Let me confirm the average weights. Border Collies typically weigh around 18-22 kg, but maybe in this context, the average is given as 16 kg. Similarly, Scottish Terriers are around 8-9 kg. So if the user's Border Collie is 16 kg and Scottish Terrier is 8 kg, combined weight would be 24 kg. But earlier in the example, there was a discrepancy where the assistant had 25 kg for Border Collie but the observation said 16. Maybe that was a mistake in the example. But for this current question, I need to use the given observations. So if the Border Collie is 16 kg and Scottish Terrier is 8 kg, adding them gives 24 kg. Therefore, the answer should be 24 kg.\n",
